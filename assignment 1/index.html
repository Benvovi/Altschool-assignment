    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="../asset/picben.jpg" alt="ben"/>
    <p><strong>School: </strong> ALT/SOE/024/0218</p>
    <p><strong>Biography and Relevant Information: </strong> (I specialize in designing and implementing DevOps strategies, leveraging Azure DevOps tools and services to orchestrate projects, repositories, branches, pipelines, app services, and policies. With a solid foundation backed by Microsoft certifications in Azure Fundamentals, Administrator Associate, and AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions, I excel in optimizing software development and delivery pipelines.

        My expertise extends beyond technical proficiency; I bring a robust background in operations and production management, having earned a Master of Science degree in this discipline from the University of Lagos. Previously, at Sterling Bank, I gained valuable experience in application support, IT service desk management, network administration, and SQL server management.
        
        In my current role as Lead DevOps for UAT, I harness tools such as Azure OpenShift and manage VMs spanning Linux and Windows environments. My passion lies in enhancing infrastructure and tooling to facilitate agile development, while focusing on elevating the security, efficiency, and quality of software products and services at the bank.)</p>
    <p><strong>Reason Why I Joined AltSchool: </strong> (I joined AltSchool Africa, because learning never stops. I saw altschool as a means to learn more about my enjoinment and tools being used to produced excellent software delivery. DevOps is about development and operation most importantly collaboration. i find it super interesting to be taking frontend course before diving into my core which is Cloud engineering. It gives me an edge to get my hands dirty and earn an additional skill )</p>
